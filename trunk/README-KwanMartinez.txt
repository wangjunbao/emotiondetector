Please build and run the program in RELEASE mode only.  

There is an issue with the provided precompiled OpenCV libraries that causes the program to crash when run in Debug mode.

To use, just position your face in front of the camera, you may have to adjust your face slightly until a yellow box is drawn around your face indicating that your face is found.  After that try making facial expressions - it works better if you move slowly.

Thank you,
