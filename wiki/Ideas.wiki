#summary Ideas and things to do

=Brainstorm!=

==Approach==
 1. Use Haar cascades to find faces
 2. Use size of face to scale our default template
 3. Search subsection of each face to find location of eyebrows, eyes, mouth
 4. Search each feature location for more precise templates (corner of eyes, iris, corner and middle point of eyebrow, corners and top and bottom of lips)
 5. 

==Challenges==
 * Changes in face size (moving towards and away from camera)
 * Changes in angle (tilting head or turning left or right)
 * Occlusion of features

==Possible Improvements / Differences from Previous Approaches==
 * Automatic detection of face and feature (Shugrina had this, Black and Yacoob did not)
 * Detecting emotion in a single image - compare to some average normal face if a normal face is not available for that person. (Black and Yacoob used video sequences)
 * Detecting emotions of multiple faces simultaneously - aggregate emotions to change output even more
 * Real-time / fast detection

==What we are tracking==
Measurements will be normalized in relation to the subject's neutral face
  * brow furrow: X distance between left eyebrow and right eyebrow
    * rightEyebrow.x - leftEyebrow.x
    * error if negative
    * hi = eyebrows are farther apart
    * lo = eyebrows are close together
  * left eyebrow raised degree: Y distance between left eyebrow and left eye
    * leftEye.y - leftEyebrow.y
    * error if negative
  * right eyebrow raised degree: Y distance between right eyebrow and right eye
    * rightEye.y - rightEyebrow.y
    * error if negative
  * amount of 'white' pixels in eye
    * greater = arousal +
    * less = arousal -
    * none = arousal 0
  * mouth height: distance between upper lip and lower lip
    * mouthBottom.y - mouthTop.y
    * error if negative
  * mouth width: distance between left part of mouth and right part of mouth 
    * mouthRight.x - mouthLeft.x
    * error if negative
  * mouth curvature: relation between upper lip and height of left/right mouth
    * mouthTop.y - (mouthLeft.y + mouthRight.y)/2
    * assuming current xy coordinate plane, + value will be smile, - value will be frown

== Emotions ==
  * Sad
  * Happy
  * Angry
  * Worried
  * Bored
