#summary Ideas and things to do

=Brainstorm!=

==Challenges==
 * Changes in face size (moving towards and away from camera)
 * Changes in angle (tilting head or turning left or right)
 * Occlusion of features

==Possible Improvements / Differences from Previous Approaches==
 * Automatic detection of face and feature (Shugrina had this, Black and Yacoob did not)
 * Detecting emotion in a single image - compare to some average normal face if a normal face is not available for that person. (Black and Yacoob used video sequences)
 * Detecting emotions of multiple faces simultaneously - aggregate emotions to change output even more
 * Real-time / fast detection
