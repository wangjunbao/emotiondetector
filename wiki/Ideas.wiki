#summary Ideas and things to do

=Brainstorm!=

==Approach==
 1. Use Haar cascades to find faces
 2. Use size of face to scale our default template
 3. Search subsection of each face to find location of eyebrows, eyes, mouth
 4. Search each feature location for more precise templates (corner of eyes, iris, corner and middle point of eyebrow, corners and top and bottom of lips)
 5. 

==Challenges==
 * Changes in face size (moving towards and away from camera)
 * Changes in angle (tilting head or turning left or right)
 * Occlusion of features

==Possible Improvements / Differences from Previous Approaches==
 * Automatic detection of face and feature (Shugrina had this, Black and Yacoob did not)
 * Detecting emotion in a single image - compare to some average normal face if a normal face is not available for that person. (Black and Yacoob used video sequences)
 * Detecting emotions of multiple faces simultaneously - aggregate emotions to change output even more
 * Real-time / fast detection

==What we are currently tracking==
  * 2 points of eyebrows
    * |leftY-rightY|
      * 
  * 4 points of mouth
    * (topY-bottomY) 
      * greater = arousal + 
      * less = arousal -
      * none = arousal 0
    * |leftY-rightY|
  * degree of white pixels in eye?
    * greater = arousal +
    * less = arousal -
    * none = arousal 0
